    "#### Article Summary and Inspiration\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide presents a comprehensive checklist and accompanying theory for experimental design and execution of ABN tests, using feature optimization of Lyft's shared rides as a real-world application example in each section. It aims to fill the gaps in non-specialized teaching material for AB testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article:\n",
    "- I first walk through all the design and execution considerations of an A/B/N test in the General Framework section, providing aimed at optimizing the maximum wait times shown to users requesting shared rides.\n",
    "- Secondly, I revise key ideas to be wary of while designing and executing an A/B test in the Malpractices to Avoid section.\n",
    "- Finally, I provide a thorough plan for setting up an A/B/N test for the max wait time feature of Lyft's shared rides service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plan meticulously outlines the experimental design, including identifying key metrics such as ride cancellations, feature usage, and overall app interaction, defining key stratification features, and avoiding two-sided market dependencies. The experiment utilizes a combination of continuous, categorical, and binary metrics to evaluate both direct impacts on user experience and indirect effects on Lyft's operational efficiency. Additionally, it details the importance of stratification and careful sample sizing to ensure robustness and accuracy in the results. The goal is to accurately measure how changes in wait times influence user decisions and overall satisfaction, guiding Lyft in optimizing their service to better meet customer needs and enhance profitability."

    "<u>**Example Application**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the top metrics that I would focus on for our max wait time example with Lyft's ride share feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metrics:\n",
    "1. Cancellations on Wait-Time Screen:\n",
    "    - Upon entering a destination, the Lyft user is presented with a list of methods to transport them and prices for each. Once they choose \"shared ride\", they wait to be matched with a driver and another user, and then receive a wait time. The most immediate response to seeing the wait time is to cancel or wait for the ride.\n",
    "    - This would be a binary variable tracking, for each instance that a ride is requested an a wait time is given, whether the user cancels the ride before starting the trip.\n",
    "2. Feature Usage:\n",
    "    - Our example conditions on users who are already interested in shared rides. Users may link long wait times to the shared ride feature and decide to avoid the feature if they experience wait times above their max preference.\n",
    "    - I would track the number of shared-rides per unit of time chosen for randomization.\n",
    "3. App Usage:\n",
    "    - We should also consider how varying the wait time affects user's general preference for Lyft over competitors like Uber and substitutes like public transit.\n",
    "    - I would track the number of times the app is opened and any product is interacted with, per unit of time chosen for randomization.\n",
    "4. Shared-Rides Gross Profit:\n",
    "    - In a two-sided market with algorithm-controlled incentives and pricing, there are many moving parts. Including a metric that tracks the revenues and expenses of operations directly linked to shared rides gives us a method to catch and diagnose unforeseen effects of our max wait time treatments.\n",
    "    - This metric assumes that the revenues, incentives, base driver pay, and other expenses of shared rides can be separated from other business operations like non-shared rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter metrics:\n",
    "1. Customer App Ratings:\n",
    "    - Optimally, I would test ride ratings and app ratings, but if I had to choose one option to keep the metric list short, I would choose app ratings to include users that are turned away by excessive wait times and never get a change to rate a ride after being given a treatment.\n",
    "    - This would be a categorical variable tracking the rating from 1 to 5 stars, for each rating a user submits.\n",
    "2. Driver App Ratings:\n",
    "    - Lyft operates in a two-way market. Without satisfied drivers, there is no Lyft service. It's possible that changing max wait time changes how some drivers experience the rider assignment algorithm. Thus, I would also catch any unforeseen problems for drivers with this feature.\n",
    "    - This would be a categorical variable tracking the rating from 1 to 5 stars, for each rating a driver submits.\n",
    "3. Cancellations on Finding-Driver Screen:\n",
    "    - As well as user behavior, we should consider algorithm behavior. Decreasing the max wait time means the matching algorithm will wait to give users a ride until a driver and shared ride user are close enough, potentially leading to the same wait times, just on a different waiting screen. Thus, we should also measure cancellation rate and average wait time for the period between selecting shared rides and receiving a driver and wait time.\n",
    "    - This would be a binary variable tracking, for each instance that a ride is requested, whether the user cancels the ride before a wait time is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariant metrics:\n",
    "1. Hour and Day:\n",
    "    - Users are more likely to be rushed or relaxed during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Morning periods on weekdays likely have many rushed users going to work, whereas morning periods on weekends likely have many less rushed users.\n",
    "2. Pick-up / Drop-off Location:\n",
    "    - As well as time metrics, rushed and relaxed users are likely to be correlated to the location they order from. Rush users are more likely to be leaving the house (e.g., going to work or to an event or hobby with scheduled hours) or going to specific locations (e.g. the airport). Relaxed users are more likely to be returning home (e.g., from work or from an event or hobby).\n",
    "3. Loyal vs Efficient:\n",
    "    - The max wait time a customer is comfortable with is likely different between customers who regularly check multiple ride-hailing apps when searching for a ride (the market \"efficient\" users) and customers that only check the Lyft app (the \"loyal\" customers\")."

    "Evaluation metrics:\n",
    "1. Cancellations on Wait-Time Screen:\n",
    "    - Upon entering a destination, the Lyft user is presented with a list of methods to transport them and prices for each. Once they choose \"shared ride\", they wait to be matched with a driver and another user, and then receive a wait time. The most immediate response to seeing the wait time is to cancel or wait for the ride.\n",
    "    - This would be a binary variable tracking, for each instance that a ride is requested an a wait time is given, whether the user cancels the ride before starting the trip.\n",
    "2. Feature Usage:\n",
    "    - Our example conditions on users who are already interested in shared rides. Users may link long wait times to the shared ride feature and decide to avoid the feature if they experience wait times above their max preference.\n",
    "    - I would track the number of shared-rides per unit of time chosen for randomization.\n",
    "3. App Usage:\n",
    "    - We should also consider how varying the wait time affects user's general preference for Lyft over competitors like Uber and substitutes like public transit.\n",
    "    - I would track the number of times the app is opened and any product is interacted with, per unit of time chosen for randomization.\n",
    "4. Shared-Rides Gross Profit:\n",
    "    - In a two-sided market with algorithm-controlled incentives and pricing, there are many moving parts. Including a metric that tracks the revenues and expenses of operations directly linked to shared rides gives us a method to catch and diagnose unforeseen effects of our max wait time treatments.\n",
    "    - This metric assumes that the revenues, incentives, base driver pay, and other expenses of shared rides can be separated from other business operations like non-shared rides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Counter metrics:\n",
    "1. Customer App Ratings:\n",
    "    - Optimally, I would test ride ratings and app ratings, but if I had to choose one option to keep the metric list short, I would choose app ratings to include users that are turned away by excessive wait times and never get a change to rate a ride after being given a treatment.\n",
    "    - This would be a categorical variable tracking the rating from 1 to 5 stars, for each rating a user submits.\n",
    "2. Driver App Ratings:\n",
    "    - Lyft operates in a two-way market. Without satisfied drivers, there is no Lyft service. It's possible that changing max wait time changes how some drivers experience the rider assignment algorithm. Thus, I would also catch any unforeseen problems for drivers with this feature.\n",
    "    - This would be a categorical variable tracking the rating from 1 to 5 stars, for each rating a driver submits.\n",
    "3. Cancellations on Finding-Driver Screen:\n",
    "    - As well as user behavior, we should consider algorithm behavior. Decreasing the max wait time means the matching algorithm will wait to give users a ride until a driver and shared ride user are close enough, potentially leading to the same wait times, just on a different waiting screen. Thus, we should also measure cancellation rate and average wait time for the period between selecting shared rides and receiving a driver and wait time.\n",
    "    - This would be a binary variable tracking, for each instance that a ride is requested, whether the user cancels the ride before a wait time is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariant metrics:\n",
    "1. Hour and Day:\n",
    "    - Users are more likely to be rushed or relaxed during certain hours of the day and days of the week. Morning periods on weekdays likely have many rushed users going to work, whereas morning periods on weekends likely have many less rushed users.\n",
    "2. Pick-up / Drop-off Location:\n",
    "    - As well as time metrics, rushed and relaxed users are likely to be correlated to the location they order from. Rush users are more likely to be leaving the house (e.g., going to work or to an event or hobby with scheduled hours) or going to specific locations (e.g. the airport). Relaxed users are more likely to be returning home (e.g., from work or from an event or hobby).\n",
    "3. Loyal vs Efficient:\n",
    "    - The max wait time a customer is comfortable with is likely different between customers who regularly check multiple ride-hailing apps when searching for a ride (the market \"efficient\" users) and customers that only check the Lyft app (the \"loyal\" customers\")."

    "Lyft operates in a two sided market, so our independent units assumption is false if we chose users as the only unit of randomization. Our two known options are geo-based and time-based randomization. Geo-based randomization is not a great resolution for our Lyft example because geographical regions are likely to be strongly dependent until we zoom out to the city level, at which point the number of units (number of cities) is very small, making it difficult to create treatment and control groups with equal distributions of confounding variables. Time-based randomization is a great option as our treatments will likely have an immediate effect on users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The units of randomization would therefore be users and time, and the units of diversion would be Lyft's user identifier and the ID given to each time unit. Specifically, I would run the trial over a two-week period and divide this experimental period into 2016 10-minute time-units. Since I've chosen a series of paired tests, I would first randomize by users to fill the g treatment and control groups, and then randomize assignment of each time-unit to one of the g groups.\n",

    "Although using a single, long time period per group would avoid the resource sharing problem of Lyft's two-sided market, as explained in [Stratification along Time](#2d-stratification-along-time), randomizing by multiple, short periods allows us to account for time as a confounder."

    "\n",
    "Setting the sample ratio is a key consideration in this experimental design due to the nature of the treatment being tested: Testing a range of max wait times risks hurting business goals in two ways. Firstly, short term revenue losses in situations where customers encounter a wait time above their tolerance and choose to look for a ride with competitor apps. Secondly, let's consider the type of customer that prefers to stick with a single ride hailing app until it causes them efficiency problems, instead of regularly compare apps for the best prices and times. For these customers, encounter multiple instances of long max wait times may cause them to switch to a competitor and not consider Lyft again for a long period. This risk is possible even considering that max wait times are being tested only in the ride sharing feature, which is likely used by cost-conscious customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I would opt for keeping the treatment groups much smaller than the control, which will have the smallest max wait time. The exact sample sizes will be determined in step 3 when we decide on the statistical test and power needed for the experiment."
